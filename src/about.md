I’m a full-stack developer with client management experience, passionate about building clean, efficient architecture for scalable web apps while continuously trying new solutions.

I studied Environmental Science in undergrad and went back to school at CUNY City Tech to learn design and development principles on top of my self–taught front–end skills.

I love hotdogs and have a couple favorite vendors across the city.

I like hiking, camping, and using anything with wheels instead of walking.

My climbing shoes and chalk have been collecting dust but maybe soon I will get back at it.
